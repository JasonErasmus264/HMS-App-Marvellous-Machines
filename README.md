## Backend💻

### Backend Prerequisites⚙

🛑**Warning**: This application has been tested on Windows 10 and 11. If you encounter any issues, please refer to the appropriate documentation for your operating system.

- 🐳 [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) - Ensure Docker is running.
- If you plan to build the Node.js app locally:
  - 🌐 [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Download the latest LTS version.
  - 🛠️ [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) - Optional, for database management.

### Important Note

When cloning the repository, save it in a folder with **no special characters or spaces** in the path.

## Getting Started🚀

**Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JasonErasmus264/hms_app_marvellous_machines.git
   cd hms_app_marvellous_machines
   ```

## Running the Application🏃‍♂

### Option 1: Use Docker (Recommended)🐋

Using Docker is the simplest way to run the application. Just run the following command in the root directory:
```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```
- This command builds the images and runs the containers in detached mode. Once the application is running, you can use an API client like Postman to test the endpoints.

Try accessing the API at `http://localhost:3000`. If that doesn't work, you can also try:
- `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
- `http://0.0.0.0:3000`

To stop the application, use:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Option 2: Build Locally🖥

If you prefer to build the backend locally:
1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. **Create a `.env` file** in the `backend` folder and fill it with the following content (replace the placeholder values accordingly):
   ```
   # Database Credentials
   MYSQL_HOST=localhost
   MYSQL_USER=root
   MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_password_here
   MYSQL_DATABASE=your_db_name_here
   MYSQL_PORT=3306

   # JWT Secrets
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your_jwt_refresh_secret_key

   # JWT Expiration Times
   JWT_ACCESS_EXPIRES=10m     # Access token expiration (10 minutes)
   JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES=1h    # Refresh token expiration (1 hour)

   # Application Settings
   PORT=3000             # The port the application runs on

   # Rate Limiter Configuration
   LOGIN_RATE_LIMIT_MAX=5       # Max login attempts

   # Email Service (Outlook)
   EMAIL_USER=put_your_email_here
   EMAIL_PASS=put_your_email_password_here
   EMAIL_SERVICE=Outlook
   # Email Service (Gmail)
   EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
   EMAIL_USER=put_your_email_here
   EMAIL_PASS=put_your_app_password_here (must turn on 2FA on account)


   # Nextcloud Configuration 
   NEXTCLOUD_URL=https://your_nextcloud_url_here 
   NEXTCLOUD_USERNAME=your_username_here

3. Go to **Developer options** and enable **USB debugging**.
4. Connect your device to your PC using a USB cable and allow debugging permissions.

### 8. Install Java Development Kit (JDK)☕
- Android development requires a JDK. Download and install [JDK 8 or higher](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

### 9. Install Xcode (for macOS/iOS Development, if applicable)🍏
- If you're on macOS and want to develop for iOS, install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).
  - After installation, open Xcode, go to **Preferences** > **Locations**, and set the **Command Line Tools** to the latest Xcode version.

### 10. Run `flutter doctor`🩺
- Open a terminal or command prompt and run:
  ```bash
   flutter doctor
   ```

This checks your setup for any missing dependencies. Follow any instructions it gives to resolve issues.

**Example output:**
```bash

```



### Running the Frontend🏃‍♀️

1. In the root directory of the project, run the following command to get all required dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```


2. Once dependencies are installed, run the application:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
3. If you're running the frontend on a PC, you'll be prompted to select a browser. You will see options similar to the following:


   ```bash
   Connected devices:
   Chrome (web) • chrome • web-javascript • Google Chrome 129.0.6668.90
   Edge (web)   • edge   • web-javascript • Microsoft Edge 129.0.2792.79
   [1]: Chrome (chrome)
   [2]: Edge (edge)
   Please choose one (or "q" to quit):
   ```
   Choose the browser you'd like to run the application on by typing the corresponding number.

### API URL Setup for Mobile Devices (Emulator & Physical)🚀

When running your Flutter app on an **Android emulator** or **physical device**, you need to adjust the base URL in your API calls. By default, the `localhost` address will not work because the mobile environment doesn't see the local development server directly.

### 1. Modify the `api_calls.dart` file📝

Go to the `lib/backend/api_requests/api_calls.dart` file. Replace the current `localhost` with the appropriate IP address depending on your setup:

- For **Android emulators**, use `10.0.2.2` instead of `localhost`.
- For **physical devices**, replace `localhost` with your PC's local IP address.

### 2. For Physical Devices, Replace `localhost` with Your Machine's IP Address🌐

Open a terminal or command prompt and find your IP address by running:

#### Windows:
```bash
ipconfig
```

Look for your local IPv4 address (usually something like 192.168.x.x).

#### macOS/Linux:
```bash
ifconfig
```


Your IP will typically be under `inet`.

### 3. Update All Instances of `localhost`🔄
Once you have your IP address, go to the `api_calls.dart` file and replace `localhost` with your machine's IP.

Use `Ctrl + F` in your code editor to search for `localhost` and replace it with either `10.0.2.2` (for emulator) or your local IP (for physical devices).


```dart
class UserGroup {
  static String getBaseUrl({
    String? token = '',
  }) =>
      'http://YOUR_LOCAL_IP:3000';  // Replace with your actual IP, e.g., 'http://192.168.1.100:3000'

  static Map<String, String> headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer [token]',
  };

  static GetUserCall getUserCall = GetUserCall();
  static UpdateUserCall updateUserCall = UpdateUserCall();
  static UpdatePasswordCall updatePasswordCall = UpdatePasswordCall();
  static UploadProfilePictureCall uploadProfilePictureCall =
      UploadProfilePictureCall();

  static final interceptors = [
    RefreshToken(),
  ];
}
```

Now, the mobile application will communicate with the backend server running on your local machine!

If you're running the app on an emulator, simply use:

```bash
flutter run
```

However, if you're running the app on a physical device, make sure your device is connected via USB, and USB debugging is enabled. The device needs to stay plugged in during development.
